This post is not going into the obvious benefits of blogging. It is not a how-to tutorial either. What I want to talk about here is the characteristics and features that a good **technical blog**, especially a personal one, should have.


## 1. Great content

This needs no further explanation.

## 2. Comment section

Unless you want to keep your blog as a private space where you dump your thoughts or document stuff for your own sake, make it interactive with a comment section. This is one of the first places you have discussions with strangers who may become your internet friends later.

What's more important is that you may have opinionated, even debatable views on some specific subjects. Controversial opinions call for heated arguments. They give you an opportunity to defend your views and learn from others. Thus, make sure you have some space for comments.

Plus, isn't it a straightforward way to see how interested your audience is in your content?

Regarding the setup, I recommend [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances), an excellent option for comments since it looks elegant, is open-source and lightweight. Try it when you finish reading this post :smiley:.

## 3. Tagging & Search

These features provide readers with some typical ways to explore a blog. For some cases, it helps first-time readers find related posts more easily, which increases the chances of revisiting. Retaining visitors is key to growing your reader base!

As a person who loves minimalism, I would integrate the search bar into my homepage and implement some enhancements such as

  * Tag search
  * Fuzzy search on content

That way the UI will be simpler, but for now these are still on my todo list.

I would say tagging and search are not a must, since for many blogs, the number of posts is small enough that they can be listed on just one single page without much scrolling required. If that is the case, why not just leverage your browser's built-in search tool?

Anyways, the ability to search and filter posts by tags can make your blog more user-friendly.
